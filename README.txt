For K-Nearest Neighbor ----> python3 the2_kNN.py

For K-means Clustering ----> python3 the2_kMeans.py

For Hiearchical Agglomerative Clustering ----> the2_hac.py


I could not implement centroid linkage criterion so it will give you same output with average linkage criteria. I comment all of the .py files how can you run with associated model and also K values for clustering.

For kNN, it will produce crossaccuracy.png and accuracy.png you can change the k values from the main function

For K-means, it will produce part2.png for resultant clusters and elbowmethod.png for elbow method. (It will last 3-4 minutes to get our elbow method.png you can decrease the time by setting range values for elbow method). For the given code does not elbow method because I comment that lines, you can uncomment and use it to create our elbowmethod.png

For Hiearchical Agglomerative Clustering, it will produce part3.png you can uncomment and try different linkage criteria and also different dataset.
